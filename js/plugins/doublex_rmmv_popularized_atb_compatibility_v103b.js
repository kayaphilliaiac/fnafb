 *         - Stopped calling BattleManager.createActions when patb's effective

 *         - Reference tag: YEP_BattleEngineCore_HandleNewPhases

 *         - Reference tag: YEP_BattleEngineCore_StopAllActsEnd

 *         - Reference tag: YEP_BattleEngineCore_StopConfirmAllRandomSelection
 *         - Removed all Game_Action.prototype.confirm_patb_item contents     
 *         - (v1.00c+) Stopped this fix when Select Help Window is false      
 *      5. Right now wait_cond_code full and force run atb are still

 *           added by Yanfly Engine Plugins - Battle Engine Core              
 *      6. (v1.00e+) Subsequent actions of an all-selection one all wrongly   
 *         mark all party/troop members

 *         - Reference tag: YEP_BattleEngineCore_StopInputableActorReturnHome
